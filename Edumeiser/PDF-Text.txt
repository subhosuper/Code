ABSTRACT
 
 
 
 
In this current generation, one has to deal with numerous hurdles to get a vacant 
parking space for their vehicles. As it is the number of vehicles has kept on increasing at a 
swift pace
 
and has contributed to the effects of traffic congestion all the more. To deal with 
such issues one such concept that has come up and received a lot of admiration is the Smart 
Parking System. 
 
 
             
This system proposes to reduce the number of veh
icles lining up for
 
vacant
 
space in a 
parking lot. So, whenever a person plans to visit a commercial structure he/she can check the 
status of the parking lot on the respective website portal of that commercial structure from 
their mobile phones, laptops and other such accessories e
ven before going to that place. 
Otherwise, they can also check the parking status on the reception desk of that organization 
after going to that place if they are not able to access the website. By doing this, the 
unnecessary overflowing of vehicles into t
he parking lot in search of 
a 
vacant space can be 
avoided. These results are displayed on the website of such commercial properties. Even after 
all this if the person by any means happens to go into the parking area then a servo motor has 
been placed which
 
allows the vehicle to enter the parking area if there is a vacant space and if 
it is full then it does not. Also, suitable number of IR Sensors and LEDs has been correctly 
positioned in the parking spaces which enables the driver to know which of the slot
s are empty 
and occupied at the same time.
 
 
The website is designed using the cloud computerization technique which involves 
NodeMCU (ESP8266) as well as Adafruit IO as the main components behind the designing 
of the entire website. Once the website is cre
ated it is then responsible for giving the correct 
status of the parking space thus rendering a smooth experience to the user and letting them 
know about the genuine information without them having go to through the rigorous process 
of coming to that place
 
and entering the parking lot and then getting to know about the latest 
status of the parking area.

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW
 
     

become an issue of grave concern for the common masses. Research from scientists 
have demonstrated various instances of evidences which confirms that an individual 
takes
 
generally around 8 minutes to park a vehicle because of the time that one has 
to spend in searching for a parking lot. It has escalated the problems of traffic 
congestion manifolds on a global basis. The time consumed in order to find a 
parking area usual
ly contributes to the major portion of the traffic congestion. Over a 

several steps have been taken to keep a check on the issue but all of it has not been 
sufficient enough
 
to bring the desired results. The industry giants saw it as an 
opportunity to bring a massive augmentation in the revenues related to parking spots 
and thereby coming up with cost effective and efficient technological solutions to 
reduce the traffic conge
stion. This has paved the way for development of smart and 
innovative parking systems which can provide hassle free and satisfactory 
experiences to the people. To sustain the current human development, such 
kinds of 
techniques for car parking occupancy det
ection are
 
of great importance for an 
effective management of vehicle parking lots. To solve this, a solution has been 
established that can handle the navigation to defined parking lots. The current 
parking lots are not equipped enough with such automated 
systems and brings in a 
lot of problems for the drivers to find the vacant parking spots. So 
in this context, 
internet of things (
IoT
)
 
uses cloud computerization technique to connect physical 
parking space for organizational structures and enterprises, where cloud
-
based smart 
management services have been applied to deal with the issue. This connectivity shift 
among the parking systems o
f varied buildings and the drivers of the vehicles has 
brought about a drastic socio
-
economical change.

The existing parking systems take away a lot of time and effort of the drivers to get 
a vacant spot in a parking lot. To address this matter, a suitable
 
alternative would be to 
design a website using an IoT based cloud database which the drivers can have access 
to and whenever he/she visits any organization they can check on the website portal of 
the respective organizations on their phones or as well as 
check on the computer 
systems on the reception desk of the concerned organization regarding the number of 
vacant spots in the parking lot. So we propose to come up with a solution that uses an 
amalgamation of sensors, light emitting diodes (LEDs), controll
er boards, 
communication equipment, and monitoring & management software to assist the driver 
in locating the vacant spot. The most essential objective of smart parking system is to 
cut down time consumption to locate the parking areas, which in turn would
 
reduce the 
fuel consumption. Through the website portal the user can get a track of the existing 
status of a parking lot.
 
Especially when it comes to developing countries like India, the nation has to 
encounter a lot of problems for ensuring a large free 
parking space. Therefore, the 
above mentioned concept of smart parking system would be an optimal solution. A 
Mobile application that can be used to book a parking slot would be an advanced 
version of the given concept.

. MOTIVATION
 
 
    
The heavil
y crowded streets of Bengaluru has become physically as well as mentally 
a draining experience altogether for the common masses on a frequent basis. Such 
experiences on a personal level and also looking at the scenarios in various cities across 
the length 
and breadth of the country a true sense of motivation has triggered in us to 
come up with an IoT and cloud computerized answer to this complication. Hence, with 

system
 
that will be successful in diminishing the traffic congestion and also bring down 
the unnecessary consumption of fuel which is contributing drastically to the pollution 
levels of the country such that it has become a life threatening situation for th
e peo
ple.

IoT 
BASED SMART PARKING SYSTEM
 
[1]
 
The
 

IoT based smart parking system

 
is 
an IoT based smart 
parking system that can provide more than just information about vacant space but also 
helps driver to locate an available   parking slot in order to reduce traffic problem in the 
parking area. The system will detect the vehicle plate nu
mber and use it inform the driver 
where his/her car is parked and also for the purpose of security monitoring. They have 
designed this smart   parking using hardware and software based on IoT concept, and 
mobile application, the driver can easily check the
 
parking information and use mobile 
payment to pay the parking fee.  
 
In this paper, user gets information about parking slots and payment are done 
through phone which makes flexible when it comes 
to 
payment. However, handling a 
database of user looks unwa
nted since they are offering information about parking slots.

3.1.2 SERVO MOTOR
 
 
3.1.2.1
 
WHAT IS SERVO MOTOR?
 
A servo motor is an electrical device which is either used to rotate or push an
 
o
bject 
and works with great precision.
 
A servo motor is used when one has to
 
r
otate an object by a 
certain specific angle 
or distance. It is made up of 
si
mple
 
m
otor which uses servo 
mechanism to operate.
 
 
 
3.1.2.2
 
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF SERVO MOTOR
 
A servo motor 
shown in Fig. 3 
consists of a DC or AC motor, a gear assembly, a 
potentiometer and a controlling unit. First of all, a gear assembly is used to increase the 
torque of the motor and to reduce the RPM. The position at the beginning of servo motor

shaft, the position of pote
ntiometer knob is such that there is no electrical signal generated 
at the output port of the potentiometer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                               
 
Figure 3: Servo Motor
 
Now at another input terminal of the error detecting amplifier, and 
electrical signal 
is given. Now, one signal coming from the potentiometer and another coming from the 
other source is compared and the difference between these two signals will be processed in 
feedback mechanism and the output is generated as an error sign
al. This error signal is the 
actuating signal for the motor and the motor starts rotating. Now, as the motor rotates, the 
potentiometer will generate a signal since the motor shaft is connected with the 
potentiometer.
 
So, the output feedback signal of the 
potentiometer changes as its angular position
 
c
hanges. At a certain point of time, the position of the potentiometer reaches a point 
s
uch 
that the output of the potentiometer is the same as the external signal
.
 
At this point, as there is no difference 
between the external applied signal and the 
signal generated at the potentiometer, there will be no output signal from the amplifier to 
the motor input and thus the motor stops rotating.
 
Generally, for a servo motor, the angle of 
rotation ranges from 0 to 
180
º
.
 
The Pulse Width which is required for different rotations of 
the servo motor is shown in Fig. 4.

But, depending on the manufacturing, it
 
can sometimes go up to 210º
. The 
application of an electrical pulse of a proper width to control pin can bring about the 
controlled degree of rotation.
 
Pulse of 1 ms (millisecond) width can rotate servo to 0
º
, 
1.5ms can rotate to
 
90º
 
(neutral position) and 2 ms pulse can rotate it to 180
º

Therefore by using an LED which generates light at 
the same wavelength as what 
the 
sensor is expecting, one can have a look at the intensity of the received light.
 
 
3.1.3.1
 
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF IR SENSOR
 
IR source (transmitter) is used to emit radiation of
 
a required wavelength.
 
This 
radiation reaches the object and it is reflected back. The radiation that is reflected can be 
detected by the IR receiver. The IR Receiver which detects detected radiation is then 
further processed based on its intensity.  IR R
eceiver output is small and the amplifiers are 
used to amplify the detected signal.

For 
the present prototype we making use of 4 parking slots, in which each parking 
slot makes use of IR Sensor to detect whether the parking slot is full or empty.
 
We are making use of an LED in each slot to show whether the parking slot is empty or full 
by mak
ing the LED glow when the parking slot is empty, to make sure the driver does not 
face any difficulty in searching for a vacant parking slot as shown in Fig.

which 
shows the completely empty space for parking before vehicle enter in model as wel
l as web 
page.
 
            
 
We are making use of SERVO Motor for the entry at a Tollgate. When there are 
vacant parking spaces than the Tollgate open by detecting the car at entry using the help of 
an IR Sensor. When the parking slots are full we make sure the Tollgate does not 
open.
 
We
 
make use of NodeMCU for serial communication with the Arduino and the data present in 
the Arduino UNO based it transferred to the NodeMCU board and with the help of the Wi
-
Fi module in the board the data is being displayed on the WEB Application page.
 
The WEB Application displays the information about the vacancy of the parking when 
connected with the Wi
-
Fi of our prototype. This web application will help the driver to 
detect which parking slot is vacant to occupy with also makes it efficient to park th
e 
vehicles.

In this System we make use of IR Sensors to detect the vehicle 
and depending upon the 
vacancy of
 
the parking lot the toll gate either permits the vehicle to enter the parking lot if 
there is vacancy or otherwise it does not permit the vehicle to enter if the parking lot is 
filled. The real time status regarding the
 
vacancy of the parking s
lot is moni
tored on
 
the 
Adafruit Web Application and b
ased on the vacancy it guides the veh
icle to the desired 
vacant parking slot and it enables the driver to find a suitable parking space for his/her 
vehicle without a
ny sort of hassle. This 
system is designed in su
ch a way that it can render 
the best possible experience to the user and 
it 
allows the common masses to avoid the 
regular rush while searching for a parking space.

CONCLUSION
 
AND FUTURE SCOPE
 
    
 
    
 
4.1. SUMMARY
 
 
     
The ease of parking system is quite a challenge these days. Since the development of 
industrialized cities, the number of cars has been increasing and day by day and the people 
are facing bigger trouble while trying to guide their cars into a parking 
lot. This scenario of 
parking problems gives rise to new solutions with the help of the Internet of things (IoT) 
thus managing car parking systems. Our paper addresses the problems of car parking across 
a remote city and comes out with an IOT based assista
nce application system.
 
In this work, we build an IoT based smart parking system that integrates several 
physical devices (Arduino UNO, node MCU, IR sensor, servo motor, led) to check the 
parking slot availability. WEB application allows the user to locate
 
which parking slot is 
vacant and guide the vehicle to the vacant slot, navigation from the entrance gate to 

time to search parking space. A parking space model is bu
ilt for a single storage parking 
slot, but this model can be extended for multi
-
storage parking spaces.
 
 
 
4.2. APPLICATIONS
 
Below are some of the applications where the working model can be implemented 
for the use of Parking Guidance System.

4.3 LIMITATIONS
 
Although, the model works properly under normal circumstances, but it has certain 
limit
ations as listed below:
 

 
The hardware part of the parking guidance system is implemented with Arduino which 
has a very limited amount of RAM.
 

 
As for now, our project covers a smaller span of people for an ideal case and therefore 
Arduino is working fine here. But, shortly, our application covering a wider group of 
people with much more complex cases will need a more stable system like Raspberry
 
Pi.
 

 
Handling a huge amount of data may result in a complicated scenario. But, we shall make 
it strong shortly with a dedicated database. 
 

 
The data request and data retrieval system is conducted among the application, the    
Arduino and the database wh
ich may make the process a bit slower.
 

 
A transaction system could have been implemented with the digital transaction which at 
present is not included.
 
 
4.4. FUTURE SCOPE
 
F
ollowing are some of the future scopes 
to improve the proposed IoT based 
guidance s
ystem.
 

 
Our pro
ject is currently an Adafruit 
platform web application. It can be rebuilt in a multi
-
platform structure like mobile application so that is feasible for the people to use it on the 
mobile phone.

Someone with no prior knowledge about our parking based IoT system might be 
interested in our application. For those people, sequential steps can be included in the 
system so that they can use the web applicati
on without facing any problems.
 

 
By using GP
S
 
technology, user need not give their location as input. Location of the user 
will be tracked immediately as the user connects to the Wi
-
Fi and get access to the 
application.
 

 
Feedback: At first we are going to take feedback from the users in quaint way.
 
Live 
conversation feature can be incorporated to the application.
