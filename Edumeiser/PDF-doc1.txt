Center of Mass and External Forces
Learning Goal:Understand that, for many purposes, a system can be treated as a point-like particle with its mass concentrated at the center
of mass.
A complex system of objects, both point-like and extended ones, can often be treated as a 
point particle
, located at the
system's 
center of mass
. Such an approach can greatly simplify problem solving.
Before you use the center of mass approach, you should first understand the following terms:
System: 
Any
 collection of objects that are of interest to you in a particular situation. In many problems, you have
a certain freedom in choosing your system. Making a wise choice for the system is often the first step in solving
the problem efficiently.
Center of mass: The point that represents the "average" position of the entire mass of a system. The postion of
the center of mass 
 can be expressed in terms of the position vectors 
 of the particles as
.The x coordinate of the center of mass 
 can be expressed in terms of the 
x coordinates 
 of theparticles as
.Similarly, the 
y coordinate of the center of mass can be expressed.
Internal force: Any force that results from an interaction between the objects inside your system. As we will
show, the internal forces do not affect the motion of the system's center of mass.
External force: Any force acting on an object inside your system that results from an interaction with an object
outside your system.

external
 force 
 is now acting on block

ANSWER:
CorrectPart J
Consider the same system of two blocks. Now, there are two forces involved. An 
external
 force 
 is acting on block 
and another 
external
 force 
 is acting on block 
. Find thex component of the acceleration of the center of mass 
of the system.
Express your answer in terms of the 
x components 
and  of the forces, 
 and .ANSWER:
CorrectNote that, in both cases, the acceleration of mass can be found as
where 
 is the net 
external
 force applied to the system, and 
 is the total mass of the system. Even though
each force is only applied to 
one object, it affects the acceleration of the center of mass of the 
entire system
.This result is especially useful since it can be applied to a general case, involving 
any number of objects moving in
all directions and being acted upon by 
any number of 
external
 forces.

ANSWER:
CorrectPart L
Consider the same system of two blocks. Now, there are two 
internal
 forces involved. An 
internal
 force 
 is applied to
block 
 by block 
 and another 
internal
 force 
 is applied to block 
 by block 
 . Find the x component of the
acceleration of the center of mass 
 of the system.

external
forces,

You just demonstrated this to be the case for the two-body situation moving along the 
x axis; however, it is true in
more general cases as well.
A Game of Frictionless Catch
Chuck and Jackie stand on separate carts, both of which can slide without friction. The combined mass of Chuck and his
cart, 
, is identical to the combined mass of Jackie and her cart. Initially, Chuck and Jackie and their carts are at rest.
Chuck then picks up a ball of mass 
 and throws it to Jackie, who catches it. Assume that the ball travels in a straight
line parallel to the ground (ignore the effect of gravity). After Chuck throws the ball, his speed relative to the ground is 
. Thespeed of the thrown ball relative to the ground is 
.Jackie catches the ball when it reaches her, and she and her cart begin to move. Jackie's speed relative to the ground after
she catches the ball is 
.When answering the questions in this problem, keep the following in mind:
1. The original mass 
 of Chuck and his cart does not include the mass of the ball.
2. The speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity. An object's speed will always be a nonnegative quantity.
Part A
Find the relative speed 
 between Chuck and the ball after Chuck has thrown the ball.
Express the speed in terms of 
 and .Hint 1. 
How to approach the problem
All this question is asking is: "How fast are Chuck and the ball moving away from each other?" If two objects are
moving at the same speed (with respect to the ground) in the same direction, their relative speed is zero. If they
are moving at the same speed, 
, in opposite directions, their relative speed is 
. In this problem, you are given
variables for the speed of Chuck and the ball with respect to the ground, and you know that Chuck and the ball
are moving directly away from each other.

moving in opposite directions (either toward each other or away from each other), the relative speed between them
is equal to the sum of their speeds with respect to the ground. If two objects are moving in the same direction, then
the relative speed between them is the absolute value of the difference of the their two speeds with respect to the
ground.
Part B
What is the speed 
 of the ball (relative to the ground) while it is in the air?
Express your answer in terms of

How to approach the problem
Apply conservation of momentum. Equate the initial (before the ball is thrown) and final (after the ball is thrown)
momenta of the system consisting of Chuck, his cart, and the ball. Use the result from Part A to eliminate 
 from
this equation and solve for 
.Hint 2. 
Initial momentum of Chuck, his cart, and the ball
Before the ball is thrown, Chuck, his cart, and the ball are all at rest. Therefore, their total initial momentum is
zero.

ANSWER:
CorrectSurprising Exploding Firework
A mortar fires a shell of mass 
 at speed 
. The shell explodes at the top of its trajectory (shown by a star in the figure) as
designed. However, rather than creating a shower of colored flares, it breaks into just two pieces, a smaller piece of mass 
 and a larger piece of mass 
. Both pieces land at exactly the same time. The smaller piece lands perilously close to
the mortar (at a distance of zero from the mortar). The larger piece lands a distance 
 from the mortar. If there had been no
explosion, the shell would have landed a distance 
 from the mortar. Assume that air resistance and the mass of the shell's
explosive charge are negligible.
Part A
Find the distance 
 from the mortar at which the larger piece of the shell lands.
Express 
 in terms of

Find the position of the center of mass in terms of 
The two exploded pieces of the shell land at the same time. At the moment of landing, what is the distance

Express your answer in terms of 
.Hint 1. 
Key idea
The explosion only exerts 
internal
 forces on the particles. The only 
external
 force acting on the two-piece
system is gravity, so the center of mass will continue along the original trajectory of the shell.
ANSWER:
Hint 2. 
Find the position of the center of mass in terms of 
The larger piece of the shell lands a distance 
 from the mortar, and the smaller piece lands a distance zero from
the mortar. What is

A girl of mass 
 kilograms springs from a trampoline with an initial upward velocity of 
 meters per second.
At height 
 meters above the trampoline, the girl grabs a box of mass 
 kilograms.
For this problem, use 
 meters per second per second for
the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.
Part A
What is the speed 
 of the girl immediately before she grabs the box?
Express your answer numerically in meters per second.
Hint 1. 
How to approach the problem
Use conservation of energy. Find the initial kinetic energy 
 of the girl as she leaves the trampoline. Then find
her gravitational potential energy 
 just before she grabs the box (define her initial potential energy to be
zero). According to the principle of conservation of energy,

Hint 1. 
How to approach the problem
Think of the process of grabbing the box as a collision. Though the girl and the box don't collide as such, any
interaction between two objects that takes place extremely fast can be thought of as a collision. To find the

Is this "collision" elastic or inelastic?
Hint 1. 
Definition of an inelastic collision
If two objects move together with the same velocity after a collision, the collision is said to be inelastic.
ANSWER:
CorrectIn inelastic collisions, some of the system's kinetic energy is lost. In this case the kinetic energy lost is converted to
heat energy in the girl's muscles as she grabs the box, and sound energy.
Part D
What is the maximum height 
 that the girl (with box) reaches? Measure 
 with respect to the top of the
trampoline.
Express your answer numerically in meters.
Hint 1. 
How to approach the problem
Use conservation of energy. From Part B you know the velocity of the girl/box system just after the girl grabs the
box. Therefore, you can compute the kinetic energy 
 of the girl/box system just after the collision. You can
also compute the gravitational potential energy 
 of the girl/box system at this point. The sum of these two
quantities must equal the gravitational potential energy of the girl/box system at the height 
 (where their
velocity, and therefore kinetic energy, will be zero).

Correct± A Rocket in Deep Space
A rocket is fired in deep space, where gravity is negligible. In the first second it ejects 
 of its mass as exhaust gas and
has an acceleration of 
14.9 .Part A
What is the speed 
 of the exhaust gas relative to the rocket?
Express your answer numerically in kilometers per second.
Hint 1. 
How to approach the problem
In deep space gravity is negligible and there is no air resistance; thus no external forces act on the rocket and the
exhaust gas, and the total momentum of the system (rocket plus exhaust gas) is conserved. By applying
conservation of momentum, one can derive a formula for the acceleration of the rocket given the speed of the
exhaust gas relative to the rocket, the original mass of the rocket, and the rate of change of the rocket's mass
with time.
Hint 2. 
The acceleration of the rocket
By applying conservation of momentum to the system that comprises the rocket and the exhaust gas, one can
derive a formula for the acceleration of the rocket 
 in terms of the speed 
 of the exhaust gas relative to the
rocket and the mass of the rocket 
. In symbols,
,where 
 represents time. The quantity 
 is the time rate of change of the mass of the rocket, and it is a negative
quantity (the mass of the rocket decreases continuously with time as it burns fuel). Since 
 is a positive
quantity (it is the 
speed
 of the exhaust gas), the acceleration of the rocket is also positive.
(Another way to derive the formula above, is to apply the relationship 
 to the exhaust gas and note that
the force on the rocket is equal and opposite to the force on the exhaust.)
